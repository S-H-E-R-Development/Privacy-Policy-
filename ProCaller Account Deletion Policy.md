## 8. Impact on Domain Numbers

### Active Domain Numbers

If you have active domain numbers when you delete your account:

- **Immediate Deactivation:** All domain numbers stop working immediately
- **No Refunds:** No refunds for remaining validity periods
- **Reassignment:** After 30 days, domain numbers may be assigned to other users
- **Lost Access:** You lose all rights to those domain numbers permanently

### Recommendation

If you have active domain numbers you may want in the future:
1. Let them expire naturally instead of deleting your account, OR
2. Transfer or note down important information before deletion

---

## 9. Impact on Communications

### Existing Conversations

- All conversation history permanently deleted after 30 days
- People who contacted your domain numbers will no longer be able to reach you
- AI responses to your domain numbers will stop immediately

### Data Shared with Others

- People who messaged your domain numbers keep their own copies of conversations
- We don't delete data from other users' accounts
- Summary data visible to them may remain (as it's their data too)

---

## 10. Financial Implications

### Payments and Refunds

- **No Deletion Fees:** Account deletion is completely free
- **No Automatic Refunds:** Deletion doesn't automatically trigger refunds
- **Active Subscriptions:** All recurring payments stopped immediately
- **Domain Validity:** No refunds for unused domain validity periods
- **Partial Month:** No pro-rated refunds unless specifically approved

### Requesting Refunds

If you believe you're entitled to a refund:
1. Email rkverma@sherdeepai.com BEFORE deleting your account
2. Explain your situation
3. We'll review case-by-case
4. Approved refunds processed within 14 days

**Note:** Deleting your account without requesting a refund first waives refund rights.

---

## 11. Verification and Security

### Identity Verification

For your security, we may require identity verification before processing deletion requests, especially for:
- Email requests (vs. in-app requests)
- Accounts with unusual activity
- Business accounts with multiple users
- High-value domain portfolios

### Verification Methods

- Email confirmation link
- Security questions
- Temporary verification code
- Business documentation (for business accounts)

This protects you from unauthorized account deletion by others.

---

## 12. Special Situations

### Business Accounts

If you have a business account:
- Ensure all team members are notified
- Export any data you need for records
- Consider reassigning ownership instead of deletion
- Contact us for multi-user account considerations

### Active Disputes or Legal Matters

If your account is involved in:
- Legal disputes
- Fraud investigations
- Terms of Service violations
- Payment disputes

We may delay deletion until the matter is resolved, but your account will remain deactivated.

### Suspended or Banned Accounts

Even if your account was suspended or banned, you can still request deletion. The same 30-day grace period applies.
